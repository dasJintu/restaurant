            Our potatoes come fresh from the most awesome places in Idaho. We
            only use the best possible oils to fry them in. No soggy flimsy
            fires here, we serve only the best. Crisp golden fries combined with
            our special seasoning and salt. Fries are standard with every order,
            and if you didn’t get your fill there, we also have the best boiled
            peanuts in the world. Yes we said world.
